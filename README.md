# NetworkDataVisualization
Find some network data that you think is suitable and that you would like to visualize. Here are some sites that provide links to a wide variety of different graph/network datasets:
1) http://snap.stanford.edu/data/index.html
2) https://networkdata.ics.uci.edu/

R script attached for a small subset of data( first 100 records).
Output jpg file attached.

For the clarity of the graph and making things easier have considered the subset of the first 100 records only from massive data. A small subset of data can also help us in understanding the pattern of co-purchasing the products from the Amazon portal.It's just an experiment to see how to plot huge data set with thousands of nodes and edges. Have used R and R studio to read the .txt file and to plot the graph using igraph library and understand how to visualize the co-purchasing pattern of the customer. for eg if a customer bought an item which is allocated a value at node 0 it is highly likely that the customer who purchased that product also purchased the products that are linked to node 0. I am still working and trying to figure out how to plot graphs with massive number of nodes and edges with ease.
